     * This method runs before replacements and determines whether the class can be executed and do replacements or not.

     * THE PROBLEM: 
     * 
     * Let's say we have a bunch of Smart Tags in a namespaced folder and we register them using the register() method. 
     * The Smart Tags include, Foo and Bar. Let's say our replacement subject is: 'lorem {foo.x} ipsum {foo.y} lorem ipsum {bar.x}' 
     * and we'd like to replace {foo.x} and {foo.y} and leave {bar.x} untouched. Right now this is not possible. 
     * All 3 Smart Tags will be replaced in the subject because all classes are already registered.
     * 
     * This problem occurs also in Convert Forms during form rendering. When a form is using Calculations, it's very likely 
     * a calculation formula in the form {field.XXX} + {field.YYY} is included in the form's HTML layout. 
     * In Convert Forms, Smart Tag replacements run during page load. Since we have a Smart Tag for Fields {field.XXX} already registered, 
     * the Smart Tags found in the Calculations formula will be replaced by empty space (there's no submitted data yet) breaking Calculation. 
     * 
     * We need a way to determine during runtime whether a Smart Tag can run or not.
     * 
     * We could write a new method so 3rd party extension can register individual classes conditionally but this would add more work on the extension's side.
     * 
     * @return boolean
